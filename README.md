#### Installation Instruction of Pi-Hole + VPN


------------

**Brief :**<br>
*Many Cloud Hosting providers don't allow an Open DNS Resolver. So turn your server in Pi-Hole and route traffic between the DNS server is not possible. Thus we are using OpenVpn and select its internal DNS server as Pi-Hole.*<br>

**Installation Instruction :**<br>

*I prefer to use Debian server in my Case that is Debian 9, But installation process on every linux will be quite similar.*<br><br>
*Please watch my YouTube video if you stuck :*<br><br>

Welcome to this quick OpenVPN "road warrior" installer

I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup
You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them

First I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN
listening to.
IP address: [YOUR-PUBLIC-IP]

Which protocol do you want for OpenVPN connections?
   1) UDP (recommended)
   2) TCP
Protocol [1-2]: 1

What port do you want OpenVPN listening to?
Port: 1194

Which DNS do you want to use with the VPN?
   1) Current system resolvers
   2) Google
   3) OpenDNS
   4) NTT
   5) Hurricane Electric
   6) Verisign
DNS [1-6]: 1

Finally, tell me your name for the client certificate
Please, use one word only, no special characters
